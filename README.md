Current PZEM004T plugin is not compatible with PZEM004Tv30 (modbus communication). It is also not compatible with commmunication with several PZEM004T on the same serial link.
Proposal is a new Plugin for new PZEM004Tv30: Voltage/current/power/energy/frequency/cos phi probe using serial Modbus communication protocol.
Features:

    Read values
    Erase energy value
    Set and reset address
    Access to several PZEMs simultaneously
